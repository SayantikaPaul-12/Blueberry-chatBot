  -c adminEmail=YOUR_ADMIN_EMAIL \
  -c route53EmailDomain=YOUR_DOMAIN \
  -c githubRepo=osu-blueberry
```

5. Deploy the stack:
```bash
cdk deploy --all \
  -c githubToken=YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN \
  -c githubOwner=YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME \
  -c adminEmail=YOUR_ADMIN_EMAIL \
  -c route53EmailDomain=YOUR_DOMAIN \
  -c githubRepo=osu-blueberry
```

## Usage

Once the infrastructure is deployed using either of the two approaches:

1. Upload any CSV / PDF files to the S3 Bucket

2. Sync the Knowledge Base:
   - Go to AWS Console > Bedrock > Knowledge bases
   - Select the knowledge base created by the stack
   - Click the "Sync data sources" button
   - Wait for sync to complete (status will show "Available")

3. SES Email Verification (Post-Deployment)
   - An email will be sent from AWS to the provided admin email address for verification.
   - If you can't find the email, check the Spam folder and verify by clicking the given link.

5. Add User in Cognito (Post-Deployment)

    - AWS Console → Cognito → **User Pools** → `YOUR_USER_POOL_ID`  
    - Select **Users and groups** → **Create user**  
    - Fill in **Username**, **Temporary password**, and required attributes (e.g., email)  
    - Click **Create user** (the user will reset their password on first login)  

6. Deploy the Frontend:
   - Go to AWS Console > AWS Amplify
   - Select the app created by the stack
   - Access the application URL provided by Amplify 

7. Using the Application:
   - Once frontend deployment is complete, navigate to the Amplify URL
   - The chat interface will load with example queries


### Troubleshooting
1. WebSocket Connection Issues
- Error: "WebSocket connection failed"
  - Check if the AWS API Gateway WebSocket API is deployed correctly
  - Verify the WebSocket URL in the frontend environment variables
  - Ensure your AWS credentials have appropriate permissions

2. Lambda Function Errors
- Error: "Lambda function timed out"
  - Check CloudWatch logs for detailed error messages
  - Increase the Lambda function timeout in the CDK stack
  - Verify memory allocation is sufficient

3. AI Response Issues
- Error: "Knowledge base not responding"
  - Verify the Bedrock knowledge base is properly configured
  - Check if the S3 bucket contains the required data files
  - Ensure the Lambda function has proper IAM permissions

## Data Flow
The application processes user queries through a multi-stage pipeline that ensures accurate and contextual responses.

```ascii
User Query → WebSocket API → Lambda → Bedrock Agent → Knowledge Base
     ↑                                     ↓
     └──────────── Response ←─────── Email Notification
```

Component interactions:
1. User submits query through WebSocket connection
2. Lambda function processes request and invokes Bedrock Agent
3. Agent queries knowledge base and evaluates confidence
4. High confidence responses (>90%) are returned directly
5. Low confidence queries trigger admin notification workflow
6. Session logs are stored in DynamoDB for analytics
7. File uploads are processed and ingested into knowledge base

## Infrastructure

![Infrastructure diagram](./docs/infra.jpg)

### Architecture Diagram Explanation

- **User → Amplify Front-End**  
  - **1.1** User submits location & question (later their email).  
  - **1.9** Amplify returns the Bedrock agent’s answer or asks for the email when escalation is needed.

- **Amplify → Amazon API Gateway**  
  - **1.2** API Gateway receives the request from Amplify and acts as the single entry point for back-end services.

- **API Gateway → Amazon Bedrock Agent**  
  - **1.3** Gateway forwards the query to the Bedrock Agent.  
  - **1.4** Agent inspects the query and decides whether it can answer directly from its **Bedrock Knowledge Base**.

- **Bedrock Agent ↔ Knowledge Base (S3 Data Source)**  
  - A **sync-up workflow** keeps reference docs in an **S3 bucket** synchronized with the Knowledge Base.  
  - **1.6** Agent retrieves the answer and returns it to API Gateway (**1.7**), which then responds to Amplify (**1.8**).

- **Human-in-the-Loop Escalation via Amazon SES**  
  - **3.2** If the Agent cannot answer, API Gateway uses **Amazon SES** to email the question (and the user’s email) to an **Admin**.  
  - **3.3** Admin receives the email.  
  - **4.1 / 4.2** Admin replies to the user *and* the bot.  
  - **5** Admin’s answer is indexed—written to S3 and ingested into the Knowledge Base, improving future responses.

- **Admin Authentication & Document Management**  
  - **6.1 / 7.1** Admin authenticates through **Amazon Cognito** and accesses an Amplify-hosted portal.  
  - **6.3** Within the portal, the Admin uploads or edits docs in the S3 data source feeding the Knowledge Base.

- **Observability & Analytics Pipeline**  
  - **DynamoDB** stores structured logs/metrics from the Bedrock Agent; raw logs are archived in **S3**.  
  - A lightweight **LLM process** mines those S3 logs for insights.  
  - **Dashboard (7.3)** pulls aggregated data from DynamoDB to provide real-time analytics.  
  - **CloudWatch** captures infrastructure-level logs across the entire stack.

- **Data-Flow Summary**  
  1. **Primary path:** *User → Amplify → API Gateway → Bedrock Agent → Knowledge Base/S3 → User*  
  2. **Escalation path:** *API Gateway → SES → Admin → SES → Knowledge Base/S3*  
  3. **Admin management:** *Cognito-authenticated Amplify app → S3 (documents) + DynamoDB/S3 (logs) → Dashboard*

> This architecture combines a serverless web front-end, a Bedrock-powered retrieval agent, human-in-the-loop escalation, and a full observability layer—yielding immediate answers for users while letting admins curate content and monitor system health in one cohesive workflow.
